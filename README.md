# Coffee Database

This repo is my attempt to create an app, for use by coffee lovers, to log their shots/cups so that they can dial in their beans and get the best coffees that they can have. I would say it is primarily for use by espresso users, although there will be features in place for users who make things like moka pots or k-cups as well.

# Personal Inspiration

I am really excited about this app because I am a coffee lover, and I have seen applications created by other people that are meant to help one log their shots. However, those apps are paid, and I didn't want to pay for them, so I decided to make my own. This app currently connects to an SQL server on my pc, but if I ever make it something that I want other people to also be able to use, I will have to get some sort of service for that, I imagine.

# In Development

This is just a little side project of mine, so it's constantly in development - and sometimes pretty slowly. At this moment in the repo, I only have the most basic of login features working. However, I have plans to make a frontend very soon

# Frontend

This webapp's frontend will be written in the Javascript framework Vue 3. I want to make a GUI that caters very much to mobile users so that I can use this on my phone next to my coffee maker and easily log my shots.

# Backend

This webapp's backend will be written in Python, using Django to interact with the database.
