# Coffee Dial-in Companion

Coffee Dial-in Companion is a web app designed for coffee enthusiasts, particularly espresso lovers, to easily log and track their coffee-making process. The primary goal is to help users dial in their beans and consistently brew exceptional coffee. While the app is primarily targeted at espresso users, it also accommodates other brewing methods such as moka pots and K-cups.


## Personal Inspiration

As a coffee lover, I came across several apps designed to help users log their coffee brewing experiences. However, most of these apps are paid, which led me to the idea of creating my own. I wanted to develop an application that is not only free but also optimized for mobile devices, allowing users to effortlessly log their coffee brewing experiences right next to their coffee machines.


## Project Status

Coffee Dial-in Companion is a work in progress and will continue to evolve over time. The current implementation includes basic login functionality, with plans to develop a comprehensive frontend in the near future.


## Frontend

The frontend of the web app is built using the Vue.js 3 framework. The focus is on creating a user-friendly and mobile-optimized interface to ensure a seamless experience for users logging their coffee brewing sessions on their smartphones.


## Backend

The backend is powered by Python and Django, providing a robust and efficient way to interact with the database.


## Key Features (Planned)

-   Log important factors for each coffee brewing session, such as grind size, extraction time, and brew ratio.
-   Upload related images, such as latte art or shots of brewed coffee.
-   Browse and view other users' coffee brewing experiences, with an option to make brewing sessions public.
-   Access OpenAI API to utilize ChatGPT in order to give users personalized brewing advice based on the factors of their brews such as grind size, and the option to add information about what you did or didn't like about your shot that would help the ai do better.
